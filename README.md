<b>contentSetup</b> 

Many of the search APIs require API Key Information. This method can be used to set this information programmatically.

Please note this will be different for each search provider, the proper API key format is outlined in each providers readme file.

<b>contentSetupFromByFile</b>

Many of the search APIs require API Key Information. This method can be used to set this information by loading the api information from a file.

It is important to note the path provide should be from the RESOURCES directory ie it isn't a relative path.

Please note this will be different for each search provider, the proper API key format is outlined in each providers readme file.

<b>buildSearchCriteria</b>

This method provides an obstraction layer on top of each search providers criteria.

Pass an object with any of the following properties and we will create the native query format for you.

The criteria object can have any of the following:

	 {
		 latitude: (optional) put your latitude value in this property,
		 longitude: (longitude) put your latitude value in this property,
		 address: such as a city or street (if lat & lon are provide this is skipped),
		 radius : this is used to determine the search radius if the provider supports this,
		 term : narrow your by a specific term such as sushi
	 }
	 
If there are provider specific criteria just add them an additional property to the criteria object and Soup will include them for you.
	 
<b>searchContent</b>

This method performs the search and provides a collection to the callback method in the following format:

	success : true/false this provides an indicator if there is an error,
	message:  if there is a message this will tell us what it is,
	content: {
		 name: This is the name of the search value,
		 address: This is the address of the search value,
		 image_url : Image Url to be displayed,
		 phone: Phone number of the search result if applies otherwise is null,
		 web: Web Address of the search result if applies otherwise is null,
		 email: email address of the search result if applies otherwise is null,
		 site_link : links to the content providers site entry,
		 latitude: latitude of the search result,
		 longitude: longitude of the search result,
		 text : description or other text to be displayed,
		 date_info : if available date/time information associated with the search record
	 }

*Missing values or those not supported by providers will be returned as null*

## Usage
